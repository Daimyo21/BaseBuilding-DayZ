The main purpose of these files are to sync the build arrays and object placement when server restarts

These are dayz_server files from default bliss before ayan stop working on them (not the latest reality bliss by theVisad)

The files included are the only server files that have been modified.
I've commented sections in each file to show where Base Building 1.2 is modified
